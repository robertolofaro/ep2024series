# ep2024series
A repository to support the EP2024 series of articles on robertolofaro.com

# Rationale

In March 2024, following a practice that started over a decade ago, decided to create an article series to follow the journey leading to and the elections, specifically the European Parliament elections of 2024.

It will be a long series, and each episode (published from 2024-04-01) will have a "rationale" element (approximately 25%), and a "commentary" element (approximately 75%), the latter being focused on current news.

The aim is to keep each episode below the 2,000 threshold.

In some cases, will circumvent that limit by introducing visualizations.

It might be that some will be simply extracted from other online publications, but in some cases will generate those visualizations by various tools.

Whenever will have a number crunching side, will share in this repository both the visualization and the data plus concepts used to produce that visualization.

Of course: all under Apache 2.0 license (you can reuse, also commercially or embedded within your own "creations"- please only consider to reference this repository, so that other can look at the source and "fork" their own work).
